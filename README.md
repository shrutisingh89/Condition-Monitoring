# Condition-Monitoring
High versatility of hydraulic systems has led to its increasing significance in a variety of industrial applications and thus the need to ensure its efficient working. Hydraulic control valve which constitutes as a core component of the hydraulic system in controlling the flow and pressure of fluids, is inclined to have deteriorated operation due to degradation in their switching behavior, causing fluctuations in fluid pressure. So, there is a dire need to monitor fault diagnosis in hydraulic valve switching characteristics for high productivity and reliability of hydraulic systems.
